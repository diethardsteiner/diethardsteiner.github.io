 <div id="welcome-greeting"><h1>Rock it with data!</h1><h2>I have been working for many years with a lot of passion in the <b>open source business intelligence</b> world. These days I run my own consultancy called <b>Bissol Consulting Ltd</b> in <b>London, England</b>. I've written many blog posts over the years - it is about time to find a dedicated home for them! Some of my old tutorials are still available on <a href='http://diethardsteiner.blogspot.co.uk'>Blogger</a>. My articles cover various <b>Open Source</b> software packages like <b>Pentaho</b>, <b>Talend</b>, <b>Jasper Reports</b>, <b>BIRT</b> and more. The main topics covered are <b>Data Integration</b>, <b>Data Warehousing</b>, <b>Data Modeling</b>, <b>BI Server Setup</b>, <b>OLAP</b>, <b>Reporting</b>, <b>Dashboarding</b>, <b>Master Data Management</b>. In a nutshell, there should be something for everyone just slightly interested in business intelligence!<hr />

        <h2>This website provides many <b>blog posts</b> originally published by Bissol Consulting's founder <b>Diethard Steiner</b>. When he started working with Pentaho packages back in 2006 no books and hardly any documentation on Pentaho were available. His main aim was to make the Pentaho packages easier accessible to a wider audience. Diethard is an enthusiastic supporter of <b>open source</b> software.</h2>
