I had some time in my holidays to read the new [**Pentaho Business Analytics Cookbook** ](http://bit.ly/1wAiXIT) by **Sergio Ramazzina**. It's always great to see new books published that cover Pentaho tools.

Here is a brief review:

- **Target Audience**: Readers new to the Pentaho stack
- **Content**: The book provides an overview of all essential Pentaho tools. Most of the chapters provide practical examples, which will help the reader to get started quickly.
- **Conclusion**: This is an excellent *Getting Started* Guide. Concepts are explained very well and the book should provide the reader a good overview of all the **Pentaho** tools. What it is not: A detailed in-depth guide of all the tools - which would be overwhelming for new users. When you are first confronted with the Pentaho stack, you just want to read a book like this and then once you understand these core concepts, dive deeper and read some of the other books that are focused on one of the tools.
