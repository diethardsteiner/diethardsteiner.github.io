# Intro

**Pentaho Data Integration** ships with a **H2 Database Driver**. H2 is quite often used as an embedded database and has a lot of features. In tandem with PDI it is particular useful for prototyping and this is what I'll be focusing on in this very brief article. I recommend going through this [H2 tutorial](http://www.h2database.com/html/tutorial.html) since I won't cover any basics on H2 here. 

H2 can be used as an embedded DB as well as standalone server, but it can also read from and write to CSV files. 

# H2 CSV

As previously mentioned, **H2** can read from and write to **CSV files**. For this to work you have to create **one database connection per CSV file**:

Connection details:

| Type                | Value                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Connection URL File | `jdbc:h2:file://path/to/file` |
| Driver Class        | `org.h2.Driver`               |
| User                | `H2`                          |

As part of the **connection URL** you can define a SQL statement ( via the `INIT` parameter) which will be executed when the connection is initiated. Example:

```
jdbc:h2:file://tmp/h2/sales;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;MVCC=TRUE;FILE_LOCK=NO;INIT=CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (sale_date DATE, department VARCHAR(50), product_number INT, quantitiy_sold INT)
```

So within PDI just create a new **Generic JDBC connection** with these details and then simply use it with a **Table Input** or **Table Output** step.

> **Note**: For the curious reader, it is also worth right clicking on the connection in the PDI **View Panel** and clicking on the **Explore** option.



# H2 Server

Connection details:

| Type                        | Value                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Connection URL In-Memory DB | Example: `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test`. This will create a H2 db file at `~/test`. |
| Driver Class                | `org.h2.Driver`                                              |

Navigate to the `lib` folder within your PDI installation and locate the **H2 driver**:

```
lib % ls *h2*
h2-1.2.131.jar
```

Since we know the exact version of the driver now, we can issue following command (adjust to your version):

```
java -jar h2-1.2.131.jar
```

This should automatically open following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8082
```

As shown in the screenshot above, pick th **Generic H2 (Server)** setting, provide a name, specify the driver class and a JDBC connection URL similar to this one:

```
jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test;INIT=CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS myschema
```

Click on **Test Connection**. 

Then you can also click on **Connect** which will open a nice interface to run SQL statements:

![image-20201016113026130](/image-20201016113026130.png)

You will notice that our **schema** got already created.

At this point you are ready to go and you can define a new **Generic JDBC connection** in **PDI** with fairly the same settings:

And from here you just interact as usual with the DB. 

There are many more options available with H2, in example you can even make it run in a mode that simulates other DBs like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Take a look at [their documentation](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) to find out more.
